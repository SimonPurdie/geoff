study docs/SPEC.md to orient yourself
check docs/BREADCRUMBS.md # previous agents may have left info here
study docs/PLAN.md and pick the ONE most important thing to do.

IMPORTANT:
- author property based tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after your additions/changes to the files run the tests
- when tests pass, commit to deploy changes
- update docs/PLAN.md when the task is done, and do not pick a new task
- finally, if you ran into difficulties due to a lack of information about the project or environment, which you then resolved, leave a note about it in docs/BREADCRUMBS.md to help future agents.
